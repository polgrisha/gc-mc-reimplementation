### This is a project for the course of Machine Learning on Large Amounts of Data

The aim of the project is to reimplement the GC-MC algorithm from the paper [Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02263v2.pdf) and apply it to the recommendation of music and films.

The code and experimental results are contained [here](homework.ipynb) and [here](homework_english.ipynb)(English version).
